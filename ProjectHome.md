## RoOLO Contributors and Stakeholders ##
The development of RoOLO, the Repository of Open Learning Objects, was undertaken by the department of education (OISE) at the University of Toronto. This repository is still under continual development. Once completed, it will be used by the collaborative SCY project in Europe (numerous universities across Europe have a hand in the SCY project), the University of Toronto, and the University of Berkeley.

This project is an offshoot of the RoOLO project: http://code.google.com/p/roolo/

The purpose of this offshoot is to write a standalone server for the RoOLO repository which resides on top of tomcat, providing the very same rich functionality that RoOLO offers, but on a broader scale, so that various types of clients - desktop, web, and mobile applications written in any language - can seamlessly interact with RoOLO.
